# This is a fork of [Awesome Console https://github.com/anthraxx/intellij-awesome-console](https://github.com/anthraxx/intellij-awesome-console)

It's a intellj plugin that makes file-links clickable in the terminal window. 
I had some trouble getting it to work with awesome-typescript-loader output. So I just made some 
small changes for it work with relative paths that leads with a dot. 

Example:
    
    ERROR in [at-loader] ./src/app/containers/Cube/index.tsx:66:28 

With the plugin the above should now be clickable


That is all.
