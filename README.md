# This is a fork of [Awesome Console https://github.com/anthraxx/intellij-awesome-console](https://github.com/anthraxx/intellij-awesome-console)

Awesome Console is a neat little intellj plugin that makes file-links clickable in the terminal window. 
I had some trouble getting it to work with awesome-typescript-loader output. 
So I just made some changes. For example:
    
    ERROR in [at-loader] ./src/app/containers/Cube/index.tsx:66:28 

...should now be clickable in terminal, and webstorm will jump to file and postition.


That is all.
