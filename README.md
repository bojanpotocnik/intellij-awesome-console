# This is a fork of [kumorig's _Awesome Console_](https://github.com/kumorig/intellij-awesome-console)

This fork allows matching of Windows-style directories in console output.

This functionality has a potential to introduce some other bugs as noted in [Paths with spaces not supported #29](https://github.com/anthraxx/intellij-awesome-console/issues/29), however as a CLion user on Windows 10 I found this feature more important.
